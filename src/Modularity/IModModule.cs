    /// init/tick Harmony patches, the speech backend, the dev server) and the reloadable MODULE
    /// (SpeechChem.Module.dll — every feature: announcers, localization, input, UI). The split exists
    /// for hot reload (pattern ported from NonVisualCalculus): the module is byte-loaded so its dll is
    /// never file-locked, and a rebuild + /reload swaps features into the running game without
    /// a restart or another trip through the boot click-gate.
    ///
    /// Rules a module implementation must follow (each learned the hard way in NVC):
    ///  • Any Harmony patching uses a PER-LOAD UNIQUE id (e.g. "com.speechchem.module." + Guid) and
    ///    UnpatchAll(ownId) in Dispose. The host loads the NEW module before disposing the OLD one (so a
    ///    failed reload keeps the old module running) — with a fixed id, the old module's teardown
    ///    would strip the fresh load's patches.
    ///  • Never cache game objects across frames beyond what a reload can cheaply rebuild; re-derive
    ///    from GameState. Nothing is migrated across a swap — the new module starts cold.
    ///  • Own no native handles and register nothing irrevocable with the game; anything like that
    ///    belongs in the host (e.g. the Prism speech backend lives host-side for exactly this reason).
